### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I am a final-year Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. My research focuses on deep learning and single-cell genomics, with a specific emphasis on reconstructing cell lineage trees using metric learning. I am also passionate about building data science tools to facilitate collaborative research.
